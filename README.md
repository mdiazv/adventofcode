My implementation of http://adventofcode.com/

It has been 4 pleasurable years playing on this site.

* On 2015 I took the challenge to improve my python skills.
* On 2016 I'm trying to solve all the problems in Haskell!
* On 2017 I'm having a rematch with Haskell, better Haskell.
* On 2018 I gave Golang a whirl. Halfway there, stupid goblins.
* On 2019 I'm catching up with the last 10 years in the Java world.
* On 2020 I saw how my python improved but I decided to continue on C++.

Please don't use it to cheat on the site, the only thing you will win is shame...
Challenge my code, instead :)
